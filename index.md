###Sinatra Chess
This project is a web-based share-the-keyboard-with-your-opponent game of chess.  The chess library which powers the game is written in Ruby and contained in a Gem which I also authored.  This project originated out of a coding challenge to build a command line game of chess.  After completing this, I decided to get it up and running with a web-based UI powered by the Sinatra DSL.
